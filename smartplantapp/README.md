# smartplantapp

## Intro
Smartplantapp is an application that allows you to manage all your plants, providing them water an fertiliser as needed.
Using specific smartplantapp sensors, the app checks if each plant needs more or less light and if the temperature is good (Please note that support for other sensors may be limited, but if you contact us, we will be happy to implement it).
You wount even need to know how to care for them, because smartplantapp offers support for all the existing plant categories!
